<p>Currently, a sustaining engineer for Canonical, Ltd. We maintain current releases of Ubuntu with a heavier focus on LTS releases. A lot of my work tends to go on in the background with fixing bugs, getting new features in, and overall providing a helping hand to the engineering team. It is my goal to be one of the go-to guys when it comes to customer satisfaction with our current supported products. I deal with the engineers in the userspace realm and occasionally dabble in kernel space.</p>
<p>I enjoy programming in all different languages but I'm well versed in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>Shell</li>
</ul>
<p>Hobby languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>LISP dialects</li>
<li>ANSICL</li>
<li>SBCL</li>
<li>CMUCL</li>
<li>Clojure</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Dart</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>

<p>Before Canonical, I worked for 7 years at Red Hat, Inc. where I started from the bottom of the totem pole and finally ended my stay with them in their Engineering R&amp;D for Virtualization technologies. My last project with them was <strong>Matahari</strong>, which was basically systems management and monitoring for the cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matahari/matahari">Github:Matahari</a></p>
<p>I also wrote <strong>CAS</strong> (core analysis system) which provided support engineers with an automated way to take a kernel core dump and have a system provisioned and setup for the engineering team to analyze.</p>
<p><a href="https://fedorahosted.org/cas/">CAS Project</a></p>
<p>I was also a maintainer and still heavily involved with <strong>sosreport</strong>. Which is basically a system's data collector for helping engineers get a peek at a clients system in order to help further troubleshoot or reproduce an issue.</p>

<p>Finally, throughout my journey in the opensource community, handling the balance of both community and paying customers I have been lucky enough to experience both ends of the spectrum and everything in between. From my experience I've accomplished roles from frontline support calls, customer on-site visits, sustaining engineering, and engineering.</p>
<p>I am intimately familiar with processes from both Red Hat and Canonical. I've been fortunate enough to have had my contributions utilized in the progression of an idea to product launch. My understanding of procedures for customer satisfaction, setting expectations, and providing insightful education to my peers are exceptional and increasing every day.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer in getting what you paid for and the value of customer relationship. Every day I strive to exceed excellence and always on the lookout for productive ways to solve problems quicker in order to provide the highest customer satisfaction.</p>
