NAME
    App-skryf - perl blogger

DESCRIPTION
    Another blog engine utilizing Mojolicious, Markdown, Starman, Rex, and
    Ubic for a more streamlined deployable approach.

PREREQS
    I like http://perlbrew.pl, but, whatever you're comfortable with. I
    won't judge.

INSTALLATION
        $ git clone git://github.com/battlemidget/App-skryf.git
        $ cpanm --installdeps .

DEPLOY
        $ export BLOGUSER=username
        $ export BLOGSERVER=example.com

        If perlbrew is installed Rex will autoload that environment to use remotely.
        Otherwise more tinkering is required to handle the perl environment remotely.
        $ rex deploy

RUN (Development)
        $ morbo `which skryf`

RUN (Production)
    I use Ubic to manage the process

         use Ubic::Service::SimpleDaemon;
         my $service = Ubic::Service::SimpleDaemon->new(
          bin => "starman -p 9001 perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.16.3/bin/skryf -R",
          cwd => "/home/username",
          stdout => "/tmp/blog.log",
          stderr => "/tmp/blog.err.log",
          ubic_log => "/tmp/blog.ubic.log",
          user => "username"
         );
